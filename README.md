# Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Install dependencies

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies to launch the application.

## Development server

Run `yarn run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Deployments

### Bump version:

Pull latest from master, create a release branch, then run `yarn version (--major | --minor | --patch)`. This will bump the version in package.json, create the tag, and add a commit with the new tag version. The version will be automatically deployed on merge to master.

### Manual deployments:
Run `firebase init` to initialize firebase. Run `ng build --prod` to build a production version of the application. And finally `firebase deploy` to deploy the application to Firebase.
